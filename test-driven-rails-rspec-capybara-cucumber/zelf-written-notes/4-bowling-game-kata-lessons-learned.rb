note: 'the most difficult thing is to start!'

Tips:
  - start from the easiest example
    * clean slate state
      vb: default values || obj. init. || page with empty dataset etc.
  - add new examples and extend functionality
  - refactor
    * start and finish in 'GREEN'
  - keep examples small with one assertion/example
  - readability and clearness of tests is utmost important
    *tests do not get tested!
